                <p>Hana (花）is the Japanese word for flower. Katakana (ハナ), Hiragana (はな)<br>
                    This project was made as a tribute to Hana Kimura, who first inspired my life-changing journey to
                    learn Japanese. As learning Kana is often the first step in learning Japanese, I thought it would be
                    fitting to name this project in Hana's honour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hana was a professional wrestler who crossed over into the mainstream in Japan, before taking her
                    own life on May 23, 2020 after being mercilessly abused online.
                    The situation surrounding the death of Hana represents a much larger problem that we must solve
                    together. The internet and social media should be used as platforms to support eachother, instead of
                    destroying one another. We must choose to be better than that. The social media companies must
                    choose to be better than that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hana used the catchphrase, "Minna chigatte, minna ii" (みんなちがって、みんないい) which translates to "Everyone
                    is different, everyone is good." (she preferred "everyone is special" in English.) Please be kind to
                    eachother, and please don't forget Hana. Forever our funky leader, yes sir!
                </p>
