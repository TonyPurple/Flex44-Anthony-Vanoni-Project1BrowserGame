### Who needs Hana Kana?

Hana Kana should appeal to:

1. Beginners to learning Japanese, learning the Japanese syllabries is often the first of many steps on the road to fluency - Hana Kana presents a fun option to help cement what you learn.

2. Those with prior exposure to Japanese Kana that are interested in speeding up their level of recall and recognition, through repetition. The opportunity to recall randomized kana in a game scenario can be a fun way to refresh.

3. Any lover of quiz games that is willing to learn something new. Hana Kana includes a training dojo, where anyone can view each Kana, as well as play an audio sample of the pronunciation and see the correct Romaji input for each character.

	> NOTE: Romaji keyboard input is not always the same as pronunciation, so don't despair if it takes a bit of time to understand which characters have adjusted Romaji input.

### Inspiration behind the name and theme of Hana Kana

Hana (花）is the Japanese word for flower. Katakana (ハナ), Hiragana (はな)
This project was made as a tribute to Hana Kimura, who first inspired my life-changing journey to learn Japanese. As learning Kana is often the first step in learning Japanese, I thought it would be fitting to name this project in Hana's honour.

Hana was a professional wrestler who crossed over into the mainstream in Japan, before taking her own life on May 23, 2020 after being mercilessly abused online. The situation surrounding the death of Hana represents a much larger problem that we must solve together. The internet and social media should be used as platforms to support eachother, instead of destroying one another. We must choose to be better than that. The social media companies must choose to be better than that.

Hana used the catchphrase, "Minna chigatte, minna ii" (みんなちがって、みんないい) which translates to "Everyone is different, everyone is good." (she preferred "everyone is special" in English.) Please be kind to eachother, and please don't forget Hana. Forever our funky leader, yes sir!
